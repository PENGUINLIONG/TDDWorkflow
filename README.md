This repo is a workflow project which helps you extract TDD features from videos on Windows.

## TDD features
See [Wanglimin's TDD repo](https://github.com/wanglimin/TDD) for more information.

# Dependency
MATLAB: If you have changed install path for MATLAB, please relocate the lib reference in `./vs/TDDWorkflowHelper/TDDWorkflowHelper.csproj`. 

MATLAB toolboxes: [vlfeat/vlfeat](https://github.com/vlfeat/vlfeat) and [pdollar/toolbox](https://github.com/pdollar/toolbox). Please clone them and add:
  * `./toolbox/gmm` & `./toolbox/fisher`, for vlfeat/vlfeat;
  * `./classify`, for pdollar/toolbox;
to your MATLAB search path. (Note that vlfeat need to be compiled, its `.sln` file can be easily found)

caffe: [Microsoft/caffe](https://github.com/microsoft/caffe) is recommended. Build MSCaffe following the instructions and append its `./Build/[Architecture]/[Configure]` to environment vairable PATH, and its `./Build/[Architecture]/[Configure]/matcaffe` to the search paths of MATLAB.



# Install
1. Clone this repository.
2. In MATLAB, set current directory to `./matlab`. Open `TddMatlabHelper.prj`. Click 'Package' in the upper-right corner to build helper lib.
3. In Visual Studio (v12.0+), open solution `TDDWorkflow.sln` in `./vs`. Press 'F6' to build the solution.

Now TDDWorkflow is ready.

# How to use
Drag folders and drop them on each executable through 1-5 steps. The results will be stored in `Result` folders next to the videos found.
`RemoveDepthVideo` is a utility program to remove depth videos generated by Kinect, the common feature of them is that they all start with `K_`.
